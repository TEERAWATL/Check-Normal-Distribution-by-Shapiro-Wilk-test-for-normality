# Check-Normal-Distribution-by-Shapiro-Wilk-test-for-normality

## Shapiro-Wilk Test:
The Shapiro-Wilk test is a statistical test used to check if a set of data follows a normal distribution. The test has a null hypothesis (H0) that the data is normally distributed, and an alternative hypothesis (Ha) that the data is not normally distributed. The test returns a test statistic and a p-value, which can be used to determine whether the data is significantly different from a normal distribution. If the p-value is less than a significance level (usually 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected and it is concluded that the data is not normally distributed. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, the null hypothesis is not rejected and it is concluded that the data is normally distributed.

## Visualization Method:
The visualization method for checking normality involves plotting a histogram of the data and a normal curve with the same mean and standard deviation as the data. The normal curve is known as a probability density function (PDF). By comparing the shape of the histogram and the PDF, you can get a visual idea of how well the data fits a normal distribution. If the histogram and the PDF are similar in shape, it suggests that the data is close to a normal distribution.
